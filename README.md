Data scientists are often expected to collect large amounts of data to derive business value in organizations. Unfortunately, this is a skill that is often overlooked, as most data science courses don’t teach you to collect external data. Instead, there is a lot of emphasis placed on model building and training.
If you aren’t already familiar with the term, a web scraper is an automated tool that can extract large amounts of data from sites. You can collect up to hundreds of thousands of data points in just a few minutes with the help of web scraping.
I will scrape a site called “Quotes to Scrape” in this tutorial. This is a site that was specifically built to practice web scraping.
steps:
-Extracting raw HTML from a website
-Using the BeautifulSoup library to parse this HTML and extract useful pieces of information from the site
-Collecting data from multiple webpages at once
-Storing this data into a Pandas dataframe
